            <p>Hello! My name is Olinda Cadena-Thrower and I currently work in IT Operations. I spend most of my day
                fixing medical software and flight software for helicopters.</p>

            <p>When I am not in class, or fixing helicopters, I am at the gym, patrolling as part of my local police
                department, or reading. </p>

            <p>Previously I have worked at Apple HQ, and Cinemark HQ doing various technical jobs with minimal coding knowledge required. I worked primarily
                with servers, maintaining and troubleshooting them, and completed a variety of package building for machine reimaging and mass updates. 
            </p>   

            <p> I am learning coding so that I can grow my skills and start on a new career path.</p>
